## 📖 About the Project<br>
The Todo App is a simple and user-friendly task management application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps users stay organized by allowing them to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app also provides a visual progress bar to track task completion and celebrates with a confetti animation when all tasks are done. With the use of browser localStorage, tasks are saved even after refreshing the page, ensuring a smooth and reliable experience. This project demonstrates core web development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and data persistence.
